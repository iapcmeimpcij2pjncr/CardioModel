<h1>Cardio Model</h1>
<p>This project's purpose is to simulate and analyze complex cardiovascular interactions. The platform is grounded in a comprehensive computational framework that couples a biventricular finite element (FE) model with detailed coronary perfusion models across major arteries (RCA, LAD, LCx, PDA), embedded in a closed-loop representation of systemic and pulmonary circulations. This setup accounts for bidirectional myocardium-vessel interactions, intramyocardial pressure (IMP) distributions, and flow regulation mechanisms, including metabolic feedback linking myocardial work (PVA·HR) to vasodilator signals and coronary flow to contractility.</p>
<h2>Healthy Heart Model</h2>
<p>This baseline model captures myocardial demand-supply feedback, including metabolic regulation and myocardium-vessel interactions, under resting and exercise conditions, reproducing pressure-volume loops, ejection fractions, and regional blood flows in a healthy heart. Users can adjust parameters to visualize hemodynamics, stresses, and perfusion, providing insights into preventive strategies against major cardiovascular diseases, which include heart attacks and strokes as leading global causes of death.</p>
<h2>LVAD model</h2>
<p>LVAD, a mechanical pump implanted in the chest to aid the left ventricle in pumping blood for end-stage heart failure patients, is modeled here to assess its impact on hemodynamics, ventricular mechanics, and perfusion under conditions like pulmonary hypertension and exercise intolerance. Users can modify parameters to mimic LVAD as a bridge to transplant or destination therapy, visualizing real-time waveforms for pressures, flows, and stresses to explore therapeutic outcomes in cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of global mortality.</p>
